# youthcabin
the youth cabin website

This is the basic html website. All the html files and assets can be found in working_directory for the time being. Everything is still a bit of a mess and I am intending to complete all updates manually using FTP for the time being. 

Current features include:
Basic PHP api to handle email scripts for 3 registration options


Future plans / hopes:
* Grunt Compile and Minify all Javascript and CSS into one small easily transferrable package
* Mailchimp signup form on bottom footer
* Wordpress template Tags for Events page
* PHP template the whole website
* Turn the site into a 1 page angular app.
* Do it all with the Kids
* Update safe guarding policy links in footer
* fix sidebar panel in mobile view (registration, partner, volunteer, membership)
* 301 redirect for old site urls that are now defunct

If you want to contribute feel free to complete any of the tasks above, or add your own, submit pull requests and I can upload asap.

Warmest Regards,
Lindsay
