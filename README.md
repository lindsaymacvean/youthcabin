# youthcabin
the youth cabin website

This is the basic html website. All the html files and assets can be found in working_directory for the time being. Everything is still a bit of a mess and I am intending to complete all updates manually using FTP for the time being. 

Current features include:
Basic PHP api to handle email scripts for 3 registration options


Future plans / hopes:
* Grunt Compile and Minify all Javascript and CSS into one small easily transferrable package
* Mailchimp signup form on bottom footer
* Wordpress template Tags for Events page
* PHP template the whole website
* Turn the site into a 1 page angular app.
* Do it all with the Kids
* Update safe guarding policy links in footer

If you want to contribute feel free to complete any of the tasks above, or add your own, submit pull requests and I can upload asap.

Warmest Regards,
Lindsay
